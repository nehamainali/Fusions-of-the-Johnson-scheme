# Fusions-of-the-Johnson-scheme
This code is executed on GAP (version 4.11).
On GAP prompt (gap>) execute each line of code sequentially.
The code also displays the expected output after execution.

## Theoretical background
This code checks the Johnson scheme for nontrivial fusions for n up to 100 with 4<k<21.
